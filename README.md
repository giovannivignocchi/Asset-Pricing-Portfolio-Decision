# Asset-Pricing-Portfolio-Decision
his project is a strategic exercise in asset selection and risk assessment, utilizing historical data. It involves building the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio, balancing various constraints, and exploring the integration of risk-free assets, all within the framework of the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

# Strategy and Horizon
For this project, our investment strategy is a 5-year “buy and hold”. We believe that, despite the uncertainty that the markets currently have, markets will eventually resume their upward trend. As a result, for the upcoming 5-year period, we are moderately risk-seeking and comfortable with high volatility. It took ~5 years for the United States’ (US) market to recover from the Dot-com bubble, ~4 years from the 2008 crisis, and half a year from the 2020 COVID crash. Additionally, the US market has not gone below the pre-COVID market high since recovery. Therefore, we have faith in the market’s growing resilience and its ability to make sufficient gains to justify a 5-year “buy and hold” strategy.

# Economic and Business Environment
In the US, Jerome Powell had recently announced that the Federal Reserve’s aim is currently to increase rates (June 21st, 2023)1. This comes as the US market continues to hang on his every word to gauge how much economic pain the market will continue to experience. Though the announcement indicates that the Federal Reserve’s contractionary policy has not ended, it does come with some positive news. The following statements were mentioned in the recent meeting: “Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year”; “[Inflation expectations are] well-anchored”. Since inflation has been falling since July ’22, while the S&P500 has roughly grown by 6% since the same point, we believe that the US market may be able to weather further tightening without losing its capability to grow within 5 years.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index will be 3.3% in 2023 and 2.4% in 20242. PCE inflation is projected to continue declining thereafter, approaching the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2% by 2026. Additionally, the CBO also projects that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, though it will come to a halt in early 2023 due to interest rate hikes, will resume at a slow pace soon. For 2023, real GDP (inflation-adjusted) is projected to grow by just 0.1%. However, real GDP growth is projected to speed up thereafter, averaging 2.4% a year from 2024 to 2027, in response to predicted future rate cuts. Furthermore, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (MPMI) in the US is expected to reach 49.70 points by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analyst expectations3. In the long-term, the United States Manufacturing PMI is projected to trend around 53.00 points in 2024 and 52.00 points in 2025, according to Trading Economics’ econometric models. Generally speaking, a PMI value that is above 50 points towards economic growth. Though there is uncertainty for the near future, the US’s broad economic outlook is positive.

In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) sees inflation moderating and decreasing to 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 20254. It also projected that annual average GDP growth will slow to 1% in 2023 before rebounding to 1.6% in 2024 and 2025. This is in contrast with the US economy which will see its economy halt its growth in 2023, but possibly achieve better growth from 2024 to 2027. Though real GDP growth is expected to be positive, but lower than the US’s, Europe inflation outlook is better and points to the continent as potentially being less uncertain in the near future. MPMI in Europe is projected to reach 45.20 points by the end of Q4 2023. However, it is also expected to trend around 52.50 in 2024 and 51.00 in 2025, which points towards growth and supports the belief that the European economy with have a positive trend.
India, which is a country of interest to us, is expected to grow by 5.9% in 2023 and by 6.1% on average over the next five years according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)5. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), predicts that the country will experience real GDP growth of 6% between 2023 and 2024, and 7% between 2024 and 20256.

India, though it has experienced a slowdown during COVID and is currently facing inflation of 4.7% as of April 2023, has a mainly positive macroeconomic outlook7. The Central Bank of India will halt rate increases in 2023 and will keep them steady until mid-2024, when it will begin cutting rates according to OECD data, since inflation is within their acceptable range of 2% to 6%8. Additionally, the country benefitted greatly from the rise in demand of services exports. India saw services exports rise by 35% in 2022-20239. Even though goods exports decreased by 40% in the same period India still had growing net exports, which we believe will continue. Services exports will likely continue to rise as companies will keep outsourcing while others will begin outsourcing, because of widespread economic pain and businesses aiming to cut their costs.

The business environment, globally, is still difficult and uncertain, as heightened interest rates dampens growth to the point where companies have been downsizing or cost-cutting quite aggressively. However, that trend affect some countries better than others as the general trend of outsourcing, which has been amplified by recent cost-cutting efforts, has led to net export growth in India. Rates are predicted to increase soon in the US and remain elevated in both India and Europe, therefore we can only expect the business environment to remain the same or worsen in the immediate future. Banks in Europe have reported significant tightening on credit standards, credit terms, and loans to firms in Q4 2022, which is expected to continue in Q1 202310. India remains focused on anchoring inflation expectations within the Central Bank of India’s acceptable range. This will lead to dampened or halted economic growth for a time. However, there are good outcomes to look forward to, as higher rates in both Europe and India are expected to lead to bringing inflation back down to ~2% within 2 years11. This would help our Europe and India rid themselves of the problem of excessive inflation and thus appease investors’ unease. Moreover, the US is now notoriously known for the resilience of its markets. Given the economic expectations that we currently have, we are optimistic and believe that the US will have see better growth within the next 5 years. As economic growth resumes in 2024 in all 3 regions of interest, or perhaps a year or two later if we are to be pessimistic, the business environment will loosen and allow for our bullish strategy to be supported by resumed company growth. In India, due to global warming and the need to safeguard people and cities as much as possible from its effects, there will also likely be greater investment in infrastructure which should temporarily boost the economy.

# Portfolio Assets
Our chosen asset classes are stocks and ETFs. To simplify our portfolio, we have elected to gain exposure to non-stock assets via ETFs. Our portfolio will be composed of:

**Healthcare:**
• IUHC (iShares S&P 500 Health Care Sector UCITS ETF)
• IBB (iShares Biotechnology ETF)
• LLY – US (Eli Lilly and Co)

Healthcare is somewhat stable in downturns and has the potential of above average returns when you factor in Biotech. Considering the recent pandemic that the world went through, we also believe that there will be increased attention towards health care infrastructure and products.
Eli Lilly and Co is a drug manufacturing business that is known for its numerous acquisitions, and thus its very diverse product offerings12. Its acquisitions strategy has been successful so far as the company’s return on equity has not been lower than 25% since 2018 and lower than 64% since 201913. We believe that including Eli Lilly in our portfolio is in our interest since the company seeks to acquire firms that are innovative instead of risking more of their own capital to attempt to innovate themselves, which helps them circumvent the typical healthcare innovation uncertainty.

**Renewables:**
• ICLN (iShares Global Clean Energy ETF)

ICLN focuses on global clean energy, a growing segment of the energy sector that is predicted to grow significantly over the next few years. Global renewable electricity capacity is expected to increase over 60% from 2020 by 202614. This ETF contains the main players in the segment with the highest growth. We believe that this growth will persist due to global interest in clean energy and the increasing attention that is given to Sustainable and Responsible Investing.

**Tech:**
• ROBO (Global X Robo Global Robotics and Automation ETF)
• AAPL (Apple Inc.)
• MSFT (Miscrosoft Corp)

ROBO ETF focuses on artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics. The first is a booming industry predicted to grow significantly over the next few years15. The other two, though they are not the greatest objects of focus in the market, may generate outsized returns in the future as they are one of the catalysts for continued productivity growth and cost-minimization via technological innovation.

Apple is the biggest company by market capitalization. It has a large and very loyal customer base and it continuously innovates. Therefore, we believe that including Apple in our portfolio can be to our benefit.

Microsoft is the largest provider of computer operating systems, it provides the Microsoft Office Suite, and provides a cloud computing platform which helped it earn a commanding market share in the space16. Most recently, it also began investing heavily in AI, which is an industry of interest to us and that we seek exposure to.

**REIT:**
• STAG (STAG Industrial)

STAG has a portfolio of industrial properties and warehouses/distributions centres. The reasoning behind the choice of this REIT is that we believe they hold properties that generate stable income with low probability of defaulting on payments. Additionally, due to REITs distribution policy we can generate passive income that may offset any downturn in the price of the stock.

**Commodities:**
• SLV (iShares Silver Trust)

Silver ETFs should experience an uptrend within the short term as economic uncertainty persists. Since gold and silver prices are inversely correlated with market uptrends, exposure to silver will help us hedge against longer-than-expected economic uncertainty and downturns.

**Consumer Discretionary:**
• RMS – FR (Hermes International SCA)

Hermes, a luxury brand, tends to have strong price performance even during recessions. Luxury brands typically perform well regardless of economic conditions thanks to inelastic demand. The stock’s performance over time has been extremely reliable, and we have some faith that the brand will be able to continue generating high levels of returns thanks to the popularity of the brand and customer loyalty.

**Index:**
• INDA (iShares MSCI India ETF)

This ETF provides country-wide exposure to the Indian market. As mentioned beforehand, the country’s economy is expected to growth significantly and consistently over the next 5 years. Additionally, as supported by Arcano Research and Professor Ignacio de la Torre of IE Business School, India has the potential to become the 3rd biggest economy in the next 5 years. 18

Our goal with this choice of assets is to take advantage of a likely bull market over the next 5 years by picking the blue chip and resilient stocks, while accounting for possible bad surprises. As this portfolio is resilient to adverse conditions and diversified, we believe that it can generate above average returns.
